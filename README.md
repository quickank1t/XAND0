#About game
I have coded in such a way that winnig a game agnst a bot in noob mode is 95% , where as in ok mode is 30% and 0 % winning chance against a bot in pro mode.

#Technology
-core java


#There are 4 classes in the project.

<strong>1.GameXandO the main class </strong>
      It controls the flow of the game
      
<strong>2.Bot class</strong>
      It performs three functions 1. play a random move (used by all three modes) 2.check if wiining (by ok and pro mode) and 3.smart checker(used by promode bot only).
      
<strong>3.Display class</strong>
      It is used to display the state of the game
      
<strong>4.Game control</strong>
      After every move it checks that who is winnign.
